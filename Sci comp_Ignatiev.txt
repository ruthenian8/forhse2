Exercise: using truth tables, check these three equations
NOT(X) = NAND(1, X)
AND(X, Y) = NOT(NAND(X, Y))
 OR(X, Y) = NAND(NOT(X), NOT(Y)))

X | 1 | X AND Y | NOT X |
--|---|---------|-------|
0 | 1 |    1    |   1   |
1 | 1 |    0    |   0   |

X | Y |   X AND Y   |   NOT(NAND(X, Y))

Exercise: write similar formulas expressing NOT, AND, and OR in terms of NOR
NOT(X) = NOR(X, 1)
AND(X, Y) = NOR(NOT(X), NOT(Y))
OR(X, Y) = NOT(NOR(X, Y))


Exercise: why NOT and OR can't be expressed in terms of AND? Explain.
NOT can't be expressed as AND(0, X), since AND operator maps two zeros (or "false" boolean values) to zero.
For any other definition of NOT using AND one would need to use the NOT operator itself.
Likewise, to describe OR in terms of AND without the use of NAND all three "true" options should be covered. This cannot be achieved without the OR operator itself. 


Exercise: Without listing explicitly, how many possible 8-bit binary numbers are there?
2^8 = 256


Exercise: Convert X = 110 to decimal.

Exercise: Convert 11 to binary
1011

Exercise: Convert these powers of 2 into binary: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32. What do you notice?
10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000
the number of zero bits corresponds to the power of two, the last bit always being a zero.

Exercise: Convert these numbers into binary: 1, 3, 7, 15, 31 (they are all 2^n - 1 for some n). What do you notice?
1, 11, 111, 1111, 11111
The number of one-bits in the sequence always equals n.

Exercise: check that these numbers all have the same 3-bit representation: 3 = 11 = 17, 0 = 8 = 16, 2 = 10 = 18.
3	011
11	1-011
17	10-001 #not equal to previous
0	000
8	1-000
16	10-000
2	010
10	1-010
18	10-010

Exercise: complete the table by converting 2 into single-bit binary:
X0 | Y0 | Z0
---|----|----
0  | 0  | 0
1  | 0  | 1
0  | 1  | 1
1  | 1  | 0

Exercise: do the same for single-bit multiplication: write down the table of binary numbers for X0, Y0, and the binary representation of their product Z0, 
and find the logical operation which matches. We say this operation implements single-bit multiplication.
X0 | Y0 | Z0
---|----|----
0  | 0  | 0
1  | 0  | 0
0  | 1  | 0
1  | 1  | 1
The table corresponds to the AND operator.

Exercise: Using A and B as the inputs, and OUT as the output, explain how this circuit acts as NAND(A,B); for each entry in the truth table, follow the explanation above. True is "high energy" and False is "low energy".
Whenever either of the two gates is powered, the energy level is low, which corresponds to false.
So, the energy level is only high when both gates are powered, which equals the situation when both variables are equal to zero.

Exercise: show that every IPv4 can be represented by four 8bit unsigned integers, and that every 8bit unsigned integer is between 0 and 255
An 8-bit integer can denote numbers from zero to 2^8 - 1, which equals the 0-255 range.

Exercise: how many IPv4 addresses are there? Is it enough? Explain.
The number of all possible combinations of the 8-bit unsigned integers is 4294967296 or 256^4. 
Although this number is large, it has already been exceeded by the number of people on Earth as potential network users.
This leads to network providers assigning their clients IP adresses that are unique inside a specific sub-network, but not globally.
A client needs to make special arrangements in order to be assigned their own globally unique IP-address.

Exercise: use ping in a terminal to resolve a domain name. Copy-paste the command you used, and the result.

Exercise: The Multipath TCP project aims to allow TCP packets to be split across multiple network links and reassembled at the destination. 
For example, if you were uploading a 100 megabyte file to a server from your phone, it would allow you to send 75 megabytes by WiFi 
and 25 megabytes by cellular automatically. How should the ratio be chosen if you want to minimise transmission time? Minimise cellular bandwidth use? Explain.
1) cellular networks tend to have higher latency im comparison with WiFi. It means that the amount of data to be sent by the cellular network
should be reduced for better performance. The maximal amount of 25 mb could be multiplied by some weight, a possible example of which is presented below:
cellular latency / (WiFi Latency + cellular latency).
This accounts for the network difference in terms of transmission time.
2) Cellular bandwidth cannot be reduced to zero, as doing so would mean losing the advantage of the multipath TCP. A sufficient part of the data
should still be sent through the cellular network. The weighted amount of data from the previous point could by meltiplied by an additional modifier
that would let through even less data. This modifier could be calculated as follows:
cellular bandwidth / WiFi bandwidth

Exercise: UDP is popular for streaming media; explain why.
UDP is popular for streaming media, since the cost of retransmitting any of the numerous packets that make up the media data is higher,
than the cost of proceeding without it. For instance, it is troublesome to stop streaming music or video in case a negliglble part of it
was lost during the transmission. It is possible to ignore such losses in the case of the UDP protocol.

Exercise: Read the Wikipedia articles on multicast and anycast routing. 
Why is anycast good for content delivery networks, and why is multicast good for live-streaming? What are some other uses for these?
Anycast is good for content delivery networks, because in case of this methodology the routing path is chosen depending on the least latency and the least distance.
This suits the CDNs, which aim to improve the response time by minimizing the distance between the client and the addressed server, 
as this methodology allows the user request to be routed to the closest server in the network. 

Multicast is good for live-streaming, since the addressed server only needs to produce a single stream of data to serve multiple clients, as copies of data for each
of the clients would be created and routed to their destination by intermediary nodes. This diminishes the workload of the server in comparison with the case of multiple
unicast connections. As a consequence, the server can easily process and cast large amounts of data, such as videos.
